Voting: A Real world contract

  - any member can make a proposal.
  - members can vote on wether they like it.
  - after a yes threshold is met, the proposal is executed.
  - the proposal contains calldata to be a contract.
-> since the proposal can execute a message call, it could be anything from moving some funds to buying an NFT!.
      -the contract becomes like an EOA that requires voter approval for each of its actions.



Inheritance
   - Reuse common patterns and standards easily.
   - child contracts inherit function (except private ) and state variables .
   - build your functionality on top or override.
